# ${1:WindChat}
	This project contains a web-app named "windchat". This web-app is a clone
		of snapchat that I've done for the 3IE's 2016 recruiting session.

## Installation
	You just need to do the following commands in the directory of the project
		npm install
		npm start
## Usage
	Use it for send picture and to recieve from your friend. If they spam you
	too much you can block them.

## Improvement
	Some module keep to be implemented:
	* cam: a HTML5 webcam oriented module, need to handle capture of the photo
	* FBModule: A connection module, need to implement http request and add
				Facebook App-id
